# Automation and Data Analysis Framework  

## Overview  
This project provides an abstraction layer over **Playwright** and **Selenium** to enhance maintainability and streamline automation processes. It also includes **tests written using Gherkin syntax** and **data analysis capabilities leveraging Pandas**.  

## Features  
- **Custom Libraries**: A wrapper layer built on top of Playwright and Selenium to simplify automation.  
- **Gherkin-Based Testing**: Tests are defined using Gherkin syntax for better readability and structure.  
- **Data Analysis with Pandas**: Extracting and analyzing existing data efficiently.  


## Technologies Used  
- ** Selenium 🚀& Playwright 🎭** – For web automation  
- **Pandas🐼** – For data processing and analysis  
- **Gherkin📜** – For behavior-driven testing
